# Phone Book Using React/Redux and Material UI

I did not implement any CSS framework such as bootstrap because I wanted to practice inline style in each component, it seems tidier. Furthermore regarding the UI, I consider the elements provided by material-ui are nicer and clearly made for React. I did not use some of the installed package such as redux-infinite-scroll because the idea to use ```overflow``` came after.
Few things could be added such avatar in contact details and with much more time an "add a new contact" feature.

## The cool parts
- Being able to link the React parts with no trouble.
- Implementing Material Ui was very straightforward.
- Using css objects in each component/ container in order to avoid ```className```.
- Using ```display: flex``` and ```overflow``` for the first time.
- Using Redux.

## The hard parts
- Redux remains difficult and I need to practice more.
- Installing packages was a bit bit tricky. Again I need to practice more.
- Fixing some invisible contact on scrolling with ```paddingTop```/ ```marginTop``` on the ContactList was a bit tricky.
