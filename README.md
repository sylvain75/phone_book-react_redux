# Phone Book Using React/Redux and Material UI

I did not implement any css framework such as bootstrap and I wanted to practice inline style because it seems tidier than a CSS file. Furthermore regarding the UI I consider The elements provided by material-ui nicer and clearly made for React. I did not use some of the package such as redux-infinite-scroll because the idea to use ```overflow``` came after.
Few things could be added such avatar in contact details and wth much more time the adding contact feature with redux.

## The cool parts
- Being able to link the React parts with no trouble.
- Implementing Material Ui was very straightforward.
- Using css objects in each component/ container in order to avoid ```className```.
- Using ```display: flex``` and ```overflow``` for the first time.
- Using Redux.

## The hard parts
- Redux remains difficult and I need to practice more.
- Installing packages was a bit bit tricky. Again I need to practice more.
- Fixing some invisible contact on scrolling with ```paddingTop```/ ```marginTop``` on the ContactList was a bit tricky.
